# WeChat Cache Image Extractor

## Overview

WeChat Cache Image Extractor is a C# console application designed to recover images from the WeChat cache folder "Internal storage\Android\data\com.tencent.mm". This program was created because WeChat cache images do not have a file extension to hide them. It copies files from a specified source directory and its subdirectories to a specified output directory, adding a `.jpg` extension to files that are missing an extension.
